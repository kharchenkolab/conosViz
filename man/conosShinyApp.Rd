\usage{
conosShinyApp(
  con,
  N = 30,
  leaf.labels = NULL,
  tissue_mapping = NULL,
  tissue_factors = NULL,
  minsize = 0,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{con}{conos object with walktrap results}

\item{N}{number of top greedy splits to take}

\item{leaf.labels}{leaf sample label factor, for breadth calculations - must be a named factor containing all wt$names, or if wt$names is null, a factor listing cells in the same order as wt leafs}

\item{minsize}{minimum size of the branch (in number of leafs)}

\item{minbreadth}{minimum allowed breadth of a branch (measured as normalized entropy)}

\item{flat.cut}{whether to use a flat cut instead of a dynamic one}
}
